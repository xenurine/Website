					<h2> Whatâ€™s a Raspberry PI? </h2>
					<p> A raspberry pi is a range of small pocket sized single-board
						 Computers build and developed by the raspberry pi foundation.
						 The original aim of the Raspberry pi is to help people learn
						 how program and use GNU/Linux. Due to the low price and somewhat
						 powerful computer the raspberry pi can be used for projects or
						 as a home server. </p>
				 <p> The Raspberry pi foundation has a large range of fun activities
						 which you can do with your Pi. However if you want to do
						 something useful with your pi you can choose one of the guides
						 below. </p>
				<p> If you are interested in getting one you can get one for the
						Raspberry Pi Website. </p>
